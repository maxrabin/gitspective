gitspective
============

This is a result of a random idea "What would my github events look like in a timeline view?". So I built it.

This is still rough, so there are bugs. Unfortunately I can only pull down 10 pages of events from Github. I'm going to tinker with http://www.githubarchive.org/ to see if I may be able to get more from that instead.

Oh and the design is hideous. I'd welcome any designers to submit a design and I'd gladly integrate it.

TODO
--------

* Finish the views for all events
* Fix odd masonry behavior where all the events shift to the left
* Better filtering logic (Combine a few items. Not everything is filterable)
* Relate new repo events with repo list. Renaming repos results in broken links.
* Consolidate Push events for a single day. There's need to display one block per event.
* Perhaps wack the site with an ugly stick of hot pink. That may motivate a designer that's currently on the fence :)
* Render Markdown messages properly.
